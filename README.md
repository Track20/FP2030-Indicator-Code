Track20 strives to increase the understanding and use of data to inform evidence-based decision making, both through disseminating the results of our own analyses, and by supporting countries to maximize the use of their own routine service data. Some of the analyses completed using survey and service data can be complex, but Track20 is known for creating freely available, user-friendly tools that put powerful, rigorous methodology in the hands of users all over the world.
